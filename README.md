# Perch

Approve Claude Code from your MacBook's notch — and see where your tokens go.

- **Approve or deny** a permission request without leaving what you are doing.
- **Watch** live sessions: tool calls, subagents, when a turn ends.
- **Count** tokens per minute / hour / day / month, with cost and plan quota.

Status: **M10** — the native panel, activity, approvals, questions, token stats, usage
limits, jumps, notifications, and multi-agent configuration are implemented. Claude Code,
Codex, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode, Droid, Pi, Amp, Kimi, Kimi Code, Mistral Vibe, and
DeepSeek TUI/CodeWhale, WorkBuddy, CodeBuddy, Antigravity CLI, and GitHub Copilot CLI have
explicit source and configuration paths; provider-specific capabilities are reported
separately rather than silently presented as Claude features.

## Install

**Télécharger** on the site hands you the latest DMG — universal, macOS 14+. It goes
through `GET /v1/download` on the API, which resolves the newest release and redirects to a
signed URL, so the repository can stay private and the link still works for anyone. From a
clone, [Releases](../../releases) is the same file.

Drag Perch to Applications, then clear the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Perch.app
```

That step is needed because the build is ad-hoc signed rather than notarised: macOS refuses
a downloaded app it cannot check with *"Perch is damaged"*, which reads like a corrupt
download and is not one. Releases are built by `.github/workflows/dmg.yml` on every `v*` tag,
and can be built on demand from the Actions tab.

Launch it and the first screen finds your CLIs and wires compatible ones up — the bundle
carries the `scripts/` it needs, so a DMG install needs no clone. Then restart any agent
session already open; hook files are read at session start.

## Building it yourself

- macOS 14+ (Perch falls back to a floating panel on Macs with no notch)
- Swift 6 toolchain (Xcode 26+)
- Bun 1.3+ and a Postgres container — only for the leaderboard API

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh                       # creates the `perch` database
./apps/mac/Scripts/make-app.sh           # builds apps/mac/build.noindex/Perch.app
open apps/mac/build.noindex/Perch.app
./scripts/install-hooks.sh ~/my-project  # wires Claude Code into Perch
./scripts/install-hooks.sh --global      # …or once, for every project
./scripts/install-hooks.sh --codex       # …and Codex, if you use it
./scripts/usage-bridge.sh                # connects your plan's quota
./scripts/install-extension.sh           # precise terminal tabs in VS Code / Cursor
./scripts/configure-kitty.sh             # …and in kitty, if you use it
```

**Restart any Claude Code session already open** — hooks are read at session start.

**Global or project, not both.** Claude Code runs hooks from both scopes, so installing in
each makes every event arrive twice. The installer refuses the overlap; `--force` overrides,
`--uninstall <project>` takes one back out.

## Using it

Perch has no Dock icon and no menu bar item. Hover the notch for a summary, click to open the
panel, `esc` or move away to dismiss. **Right-click** for Settings, Updates, Mute and Quit.

At rest the notch shows a sprite per running agent and a live session count — live, not busy,
because a CLI waiting on you is the one worth seeing. The pill turns amber when one of them is
*blocked* — a held request or a question, something you can answer from the notch. A turn that
simply ended says `Done` and stays quiet: every turn ends, and an alert that is always on is
not an alert.
That is the whole strip: what is running, and how many. Everything else — the quota, the
controls — is one hover away, and with nothing running the strip is exactly zero wide, so a Mac
doing nothing looks like a Mac doing nothing.

A sprite plays only while that agent is working, and while it works it fights: half again the
frame rate, a hop off the floor on its own beat, every other one turned around to face the last,
and — for the one with a mouth for it — a breath of fire between hops. A session that has
stopped holds its first frame and dims.

Sprites are optional by construction. `AgentGlyph` draws its own 10×10 pixel art — a fire
lizard, a shelled swimmer, a seed-carrier, owing nobody anything — and that is what the
repository ships. Drop `agent-claude.png`, `agent-codex.png` or `agent-gemini.png` into
`apps/mac/Resources/Sprites/` and it plays those instead: one row of square frames, so the
frame count is the width divided by the height, at 10 frames a second.

A turn ending flashes one line beside the cutout for two seconds and takes it back on its own —
which session, and what it was doing. A session that ended badly and a quota window crossing
your line arrive the same way. Reaching for a flash turns it into the summary.

Each session is a card: name, last prompt, current activity, agent and terminal, age. Click it
to jump to that terminal (exact pane in iTerm2, Terminal.app, kitty, WezTerm and VS Code-family
editors; window-level elsewhere). **⌃⌥P** opens the session switcher from anywhere.

Permission requests open the notch with **Allow** (⌥↵), **Always** and **Deny** (⌥⌫).
`AskUserQuestion` and `ExitPlanMode` get their own cards — plan approval also sets the mode
(Manual / Accept edits / Bypass). "Always" writes a scoped rule to that project's
`.claude/settings.local.json`, shown before you commit to it.

> Prompts only appear when Claude Code would actually ask. Under `bypass permissions on`,
> nothing is asked and the notch shows activity only.

## Command line

```bash
Perch --diagnose            # how Perch sees your displays, and where the panel lands
Perch --status              # sessions seen, pending requests, tokens
Perch --decide allow        # answer the oldest pending request (add --remember)
Perch --answer "Postgres"   # answer an AskUserQuestion ("a | b, c" for several)
Perch --update [--install]  # check the feed, apply a verified update
Perch --report              # a diagnostic report with nothing private in it
Perch --index               # run the usage indexer in the foreground
```

## Token stats and quota

Perch reads `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` incrementally (byte offset per file) and
aggregates with cost. Two details decide whether the numbers are right: rows are keyed on
`(message.id, requestId)` because 56% of usage lines are duplicates, and cache writes are
priced per TTL (1.25x for 5 min, 2x for 1 h). Verified against an independent count on 2,290
transcripts: exact, to the token and the cent.

Quota is a different number, published in exactly one local place — the JSON Claude Code
hands the statusline. `usage-bridge.sh` sits in front of that command, caches `rate_limits`,
and replays your original statusline byte for byte (`--remove` restores it verbatim). That
bridge is the only source: Perch never reads your Keychain, and never handles a credential.

## Staying out of the way

Perch silences itself — approvals included — while the screen is locked, recorded or shared,
during Focus modes and quiet hours. Nothing is lost: the request queues, the session stays
held, a dot marks it. Completions are silent unless you ask for them.

Everything is in **Settings** (panel gear, or `Perch --settings`), backed by readable files:
`~/.perch/quiet.json`, `admission.json`, `preferences.json`, `sounds.json`.

### Sound

Every event picks its own source, written in `sounds.json` as a tagged string:

| Source | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `synth:alert` | One of ten built-in chiptune jingles, synthesised at play time |
| `system:Glass` | A macOS system sound |
| `file:/Users/you/ping.aiff` | A file you picked |
| `off` | Nothing |

The jingles — `alert`, `query`, `clear`, `fault`, `warn`, `boot`, `coin`, `nudge`, `reset`,
`welcome` — are not audio files. They are note data, played through a small NES-shaped synth
(two pulse channels, a triangle, a noise channel) rendered to a WAV in memory. Nothing was
sampled and nothing was extracted: the pixels and the notes in this app are its own. A fresh
install starts on them; the noisy events still start at `off`.

## Failing open

If Perch is not running, is killed mid-request, or takes too long, the hook exits 0 with no
output and Claude Code prompts exactly as it would without Perch. `~/.perch/runtime.json`
carries the owning pid so readers never dial a port nobody is listening on. Nothing ever sits
between Claude Code and its permission prompt — approving, denying and answering always work.

## Remote

Approve a session running on a build server from the notch on your desk. The remote hook is a
dependency-free bash script (`/dev/tcp`, falling back to `nc`) — nothing to cross-compile.

```bash
./scripts/remote.sh add build-box deploy@10.0.0.5
./scripts/remote.sh deploy build-box     # upload the hook, wire the remote's CLIs
./scripts/remote.sh connect build-box    # open the tunnel
./scripts/remote.sh usage build-box      # relay that host's quota under its own alias
./scripts/remote.sh docker               # a one-liner to paste inside a container
```

## Uninstalling

Both scripts print their plan and change nothing without `--yes`.

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh --yes                  # remove Perch from this Mac
./scripts/uninstall.sh --yes --keep-data      # …but keep the token history
./scripts/remove.sh --yes                     # the same, plus dev-only leftovers
```

`uninstall.sh` ships with the app and assumes nothing but a shell. Both remove only hook
entries pointing at `perch-hook`, and back up every file before rewriting it. Remote hosts are
reported rather than reached into.

## Privacy

Nothing leaves the machine unless you opt in to the leaderboard, and then only counters:
token totals, model, time bucket. Prompts, file paths, project names and commands never do.

Joining needs no account — anyone running Perch can take a handle and start publishing.
Open is not unlimited, though: registration is capped per address (5 an hour, 20 a day) and
publishing per builder (20 an hour, against an app that publishes at most once), so one
script cannot take every good handle or fill the board with numbers nobody earned. Reading
the board is never limited; that is what it is for. The counters live in the database, in
`rate_limits` — **apply the migrations before deploying the API**, or the limiter fails open
and says so in the logs.

## Layout

apps/vscode/  the editor extension: a manifest and one JavaScript file
scripts/      setup, install-hooks, usage-bridge, remote, release,
              uninstall.sh (ships with the app), remove.sh (dev machine)
ROADMAP.md    what is shipped and what is not
```
