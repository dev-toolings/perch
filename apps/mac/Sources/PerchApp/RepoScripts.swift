/// **Two places, in this order.** A shipped build carries its own copy in
/// `Contents/Resources/scripts`, so an app dragged out of the DMG into `/Applications` can
/// wire up the CLIs it found — without it, the onboarding's one button was a no-op on every
/// machine that installed Perch the way people actually install things. A development build
/// falls back to the repository around it (`apps/mac/build.noindex/Perch.app`), where the
/// scripts are the originals rather than a copy and an edit takes effect without a rebuild.
///
/// Still optional, and callers still handle `nil`: a bundle assembled without the copy is a
/// valid bundle, and a button that silently does nothing is worse than no button.
