# Codex speaks the same hook vocabulary as Claude Code — same event names, same payload —
# so it needs a different file and a `--source codex` flag, not a second event model.
# Any tool that speaks that same vocabulary is one row in the TOOL_SPECS table below.
# gemini-cli does not (different event names, different timeout units) so it is not wired
# up — see the comment above TOOL_SPECS.
#
# opencode has no hooks file to merge into: it loads a JS plugin instead, which is copied
# into place rather than jq-merged. See scripts/opencode-plugin/perch.js.
#
# Existing hooks are preserved: Perch entries are merged in, and any previous Perch
# entries are replaced rather than duplicated. Every site touched is recorded in
# ~/.perch/hook-sites.json so remove.sh knows where to clean up.
#
# The scopes are exclusive. Claude Code merges its global and project settings and runs
# every matching hook, so installing in both makes one event fire twice: two rows in the
# feed, and two blocked hooks for one permission. Perch drops the copies, but the second
# process still starts, so this refuses to create the overlap rather than papering over it
# — `--force` if you mean it anyway.
