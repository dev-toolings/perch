# cloned this. This one is what ships next to the app: no repo, no lib.sh, no database,
# no assumption beyond a shell. Once Perch is a DMG, this is the file someone runs after
# dragging the app to the Trash and discovering that dragging an app to the Trash has
# never removed anything an app installed.
#
# It never edits a settings file blind: every one is backed up first, the result is
# checked for being valid JSON, and a file that does not parse is left exactly as it was.
