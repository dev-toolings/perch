#   perch-remote-hook.sh <EventName> [--source claude]
#
# Runs on the server, next to the agent. Forwards the payload down an SSH reverse tunnel
# to Perch on your Mac and prints whatever Perch says to print.
#
# Deliberately dependency-free: no jq, no curl, no compiled binary to cross-compile and
# keep in step. It uses bash's own /dev/tcp, and falls back to nc where that is disabled.
# The one thing it does not do is parse JSON — the Mac sends back the exact bytes for
# stdout, so the schema lives in one tested place instead of being reimplemented in sed.
#
# Every failure path exits 0 with no output. A server that cannot reach your Mac — VPN
# dropped, laptop asleep, tunnel down — must behave exactly as if this hook did not exist.
